career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
summary: |
    Started in IT 97, 20 years of managed service, data center and operational experience. As a generalist I did everything from setting up a domain controller, architecture of virtualization environments and Citrix farms, but also firewall configurations.
    After excursions into business development and product management, I returned to a pure technology role in the cloud area. Why cloud only? At some point I got tired of discussing iOPS and why the performance of a virtualization environment doesn't fit. With cloud, the focus is on consuming the service ðŸš€.
    Focus on Microsoft Azure, security and power platform. Low code automation has become my passion. But also many cloud native topics and for example service design & development of a one click Kubernet or Nextcloud deployments as a service. Supporting operational teams in the adoption of new services or tools and their automation.
